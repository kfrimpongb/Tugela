### Challenge
Existing freelance platforms are not localized to address the diverse experiences of those in Sub-Saharan Africa. The digital payment ecosystem across Africa is also heavily fragmented causing friction in the exchange of goods and services.

### Solution
A freelance platform that seamlessly connects African youth and young professionals to on-demand work by leveraging AI to automatically recommend jobs to talent based on user profiles.

### Impact
4X increase in accessing global on-demand opportunities and a 5X average increase in the monthly salary of Tugela users vs full-time young professionals working in similar fields.  Frictionless inter/intracontinental payment solution and monetary store of value.
