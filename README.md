# Tugela
Named after the majestic river that flows through the heart of South Africa, **Tugela** not only evokes a sense of power and untamed beauty that exists on a continent rich with resources, it symbolizes the enduring spirit of a generation of youth. 

This inspiration served as the impetus in creating the **AI-powered** talent liquidity pool which connects African freelancers to the global economy. Leveraging AI and XRPL technology, Tugela provides:
- Frictionless cross-border payment solutions
- Currency store-of-value flexibility
- Job recommendations and training tailored to freelancer profiles.

### Challenge
Existing freelance platforms are not localized to address the diverse experiences of those in Sub-Saharan Africa. The digital payment ecosystem across Africa is also heavily fragmented causing friction in the exchange of goods and services.

### Solution
A freelance platform that seamlessly connects African youth and young professionals to on-demand work by leveraging AI to automatically recommend jobs to talent based on user profiles.

*User Interviews*

In August 2023, we conducted a series of interviews of freelancers and entrepreneurs based in Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya and received amazing feedback in regards to our initial designs of the Tugela application. Users walked through the onboarding flows with minimal to no instructions on how to navigate. We observed their behavioral patterns, points of friction within the user experience, and collected their feedback upon the completion of simulated engagements.

*Figma Designs*

After aggregating these results and feedback, we incorporated the insights back into the design in order to optimize the user experience. These flows can be depicted with the Figma design found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/y6DMTl5DfEuPkT41GwieqV/Tugela?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=2-8093&viewport=321%2C160%2C0.07&t=6FEreF6tjI2heDG9-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=2%3A8093).
